			        <h3>Math club talk by Rajaram Nityanada on 15th Septemper, 2016</h3>
			        This is to invite you all to a splendiferous talk by a Rajaram N. The theme is 
			        <p>Fun with geometry on a sphere.</p>
			        <p>Geo-metry, in its original meaning, was the measurement of the earth, but in our education,
                                it  became the study of figures drawn on a plane.  Considering that the surface of the earth is a good approximation to a 
                                a sphere, this deficiency can be rectified by studying figures drawn on a sphere. 
                                Here,there are no parallel lines,  similar triangles are congruent, one can construct a
                                triangle given three angles, and one can calculate its area from the sum of these angles,  
                                Many of these were known to the Indian and Arab astronomers of antiquity.  
                                The sphere also has interesting topological properties. This maths club talk will go over these and other interesting
                                properties of the sphere.</p>
